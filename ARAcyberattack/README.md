In this case study we will work to create a 1000 word report, using a cybersecurity incident as inspiration involving critical infrastructure with a focus on electricity:

## Case Study: The 2022 Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) Cyberattack

**Background:** In 2022, the major European oil refining hubs of Amsterdam-Rotterdam-Antwerp (ARA) were hit by a cyberattack[^1].

**Incident Details:** The cyberattack considerably disrupted the loading and unloading of refined product cargoes amid a 
continental energy crisis[^1]. Early reports indicate that a type of ransomware was used in the attacks.

**Impact:** The disruption could see further cascading effects, with potentially larger societal and economic 
impacts across all European countries. This incident occurred in a time of geopolitical crisis, increasing the 
chances of wider inadvertent political escalation[^1].

**Mitigation Strategies:** The incident highlighted the need for increased information sharing, partnerships, 
and collaboration to build out cyber hygiene measures in the face of these increasing destructive cyberattacks.

### Your Task
Research more about this incident, analyse the vulnerabilities that were exploited, the impact of the breach, 
and discuss the effectiveness of the mitigation strategies. 

Then write an essay detailing your analysis and insights. This will help them understand real-world cybersecurity 
incidents and enhance their research and academic writing skills.
